        DropDAV is a simple way to allow access to your Dropbox files via WebDAV.
        Mostly I made it so I could allow the new iPad Pages/Numbers/Keynote apps
        to read/write files to my Dropbox. But you can use it too!

        You'll just need to "link" your Dropbox account to this service, then choose
        a password.

        NOTE: You can only upload/download files of up to 1MB in size through WebDAV.
        This is due to <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">App Engine</a> limitations.

        DropDAV (Limited) vs DropDAV.com
    </p>
    <p style="font-style:italic; line-height: 1.7em; text-align:center;">
        There is another service, also called <a href="http://dropdav.com">DropDAV</a>, that
        seems much more comprehensive than this one. I marked this service as (Limited) to provide
        some differentiation. Please use whichever you like, I'll continue to keep this one alive since
        it doesn't cost me anything.
